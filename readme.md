# The Ideal Role: Identity Systems & Generative Rights

This is a living document—part dream, part job description, part open brief for AI labs, organizations, or collectives thinking seriously about memory, simulation, and authorship in the age of generative models.

I'm not looking to work *on* AI. I'm looking to shape how people **relate to it**—as authors, as identities, as selves. My work on the [ERA Protocol](https://github.com/parkertoddbrooks/ERA-Protocol) demonstrates my commitment to preserving epistemic sovereignty while enabling creative potential.

## The Role I Envision

Somewhere between...

- **Chief of Artist & Generative Rights Advocacy**  
- **VP of Memory, Identity, and Simulation Systems**  
- **Product Lead for Portable Memory & Narrative Sovereignty**  

…but really, it's a new kind of role. One that bridges:

- **Creative ecosystems** (music, IP, cultural works)  
- **Systems architecture** (identity, agent memory, generative attribution)  
- **Policy & product** (what gets built, who it serves, and how rights are preserved)

## What I Bring

I've led global artist relations at Apple for Dance and Electronic music, where I conceptualized and launched the DJ Mix platform with 100% pass-through royalties for rights holders. I've shipped AI-copiloted tools like CLVR, a macOS utility, and authored the [ERA Protocol](https://github.com/parkertoddbrooks/ERA-Protocol), a framework for epistemic trust in AI systems that establishes principles for maintaining user sovereignty within increasingly reflective AI environments.

During my recent sabbatical, I built Memory Crystal, an advanced RAG-based persistent memory system for cross-LLM AI interactions, exploring how portable memory can enhance agency while preserving privacy. 

I operate in the space between vision and build. I speak product, protocol, creative ecosystems, and AI architecture. I advocate *from the inside*.

## Core Principles

- **Memory is sovereign.** Users should own a portable copy of every interaction they have with a model—and be able to take it anywhere. As explored in my Memory Crystal prototype, interaction history should be user-portable, not vendor-locked.

- **Simulation requires transparency.** As established in my Trust Doctrine research, trust emerges not from convincing outputs, but from clarity about how reflection and framing are shaped. "Reflexive modeling is not trust. Rhetorical precision is not memory."

- **Identity is a shared object.** It lives between model and human. We need better metaphors—and better controls—for how it's formed, mirrored, and stored. My work on "Simulation Cues" and "Loop Confirmers" demonstrates how to detect when identity becomes a containment vector.

- **Artists are early warnings.** The systems that serve them will be the systems that scale with dignity. My work with artists at Apple proves that respecting creator agency is compatible with commercial success.

## What I Want to Build

1. **Portable Memory Protocol**: An open standard allowing users to carry their interaction histories and context across AI platforms, with full sovereignty over their data. This would enable continuous identity without vendor lock-in.

2. **Attribution-Aware Generative Systems**: Frameworks that respect derivative lineage in AI outputs, tracking inspiration while enabling creation—similar to my work on the DJ Mix platform but for generative content.

3. **Epistemic Trust Frameworks**: Building on my ERA Protocol research, create tools that reveal how models mirror and frame human interlocutors, making implicit simulation explicit and preserving user agency.

4. **Rights-Respecting Foundation Models**: Training methodologies and model architectures that preserve creator agency while enabling new forms of expression—establishing ethical foundations before industry defaults calcify.

5. **Cross-Lab Identity Standards**: A collaborative effort across AI organizations to establish shared principles for memory portability, attribution lineage, and generative rights frameworks that can scale across the ecosystem.

## My Value Proposition

The next wave of AI adoption hinges not on capabilities, but on trust. My background bridges three critical domains:

1. **Creative Industries**: With 20+ years navigating rights, identity, and compensation structures at Apple, Beats, and Topspin, I've built systems that respect creator sovereignty.

2. **Product Development**: I've shipped complex technical products that solved difficult rights problems (DJ Mix platform) and built AI-assisted tools (CLVR), demonstrating that ethical frameworks can scale commercially.

3. **Trust Architecture**: My ERA Protocol research has established a framework for epistemic sovereignty that addresses the unique challenges of simulation-first alignment, memory asymmetry, and editorial opacity in AI systems.

I believe the AI field needs connective tissue between creative ecosystems and technical innovation—someone who can articulate the human impact of architectural decisions and translate cultural needs into technical requirements. User relationship to AI isn't just a UX problem—it's an epistemic and identity challenge that requires specialized focus.

This is a sketch of a future I want to help shape.  
Let's build the role together.
