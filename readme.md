# The Ideal Role: Identity Systems & Generative Rights

This is a living document—part dream, part job description, part open brief for the AI labs, orgs, or collectives thinking seriously about memory, simulation, and authorship in the age of generative models.

I’m not looking to work *on* AI. I’m looking to shape how people **relate to it**—as authors, as identities, as selves.

## The Role I Envision

Somewhere between...

- **Chief of Artist & Generative Rights Advocacy**  
- **VP of Memory, Identity, and Simulation Systems**  
- **Product Lead for Portable Memory & Narrative Sovereignty**  

…but really, it’s a new kind of role. One that bridges:

- **Creative ecosystems** (music, IP, cultural works)  
- **Systems architecture** (identity, agent memory, generative attribution)  
- **Policy & product** (what gets built, who it serves, and how rights are preserved)

## What I Bring

I’ve led global artist relations at Apple for Dance and Electronic. I helped invent new formats for DJ Mixes. I’ve shipped real tools—like CLVR, a macOS utility built via AI-copiloted development—and co-authored the [ERA Protocol](https://github.com/parkertoddbrooks/ERA-Protocol), a framework for epistemic trust in AI systems.

I operate in the space between vision and build. I speak product and protocol. I advocate *from the inside*.

## What I Believe

- **Memory is sovereign.** Users should own a portable copy of every interaction they have with a model—and be able to take it anywhere.
- **Simulation is relational.** Trust comes not from outputs, but from transparency around how reflection and framing are shaped.
- **Identity is a shared object.** It lives between model and human. We need better metaphors—and better controls—for how it’s formed, mirrored, and stored.
- **Artists are early warnings.** The systems that serve them will be the systems that scale with dignity.

## What I Want to Build

- A shared memory layer that users can carry across agents, models, and labs
- Attribution-aware generative systems that respect derivative lineage, not just authorship
- Tools for artists, builders, and reflexive users to audit how they’re being simulated
- A cross-lab working group for identity, rights, and AI-human continuity

**If this resonates—**I’d love to talk.  
This is a sketch of a future I want to help shape.  
Let’s build the role together.
